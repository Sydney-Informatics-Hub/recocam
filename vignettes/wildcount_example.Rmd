```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

First, make sure that you have reinstalled **recocam**.

```{r}
install_github("https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/recocam", upgrade = "always")
library(recocam)
library(tidyverse)
```

Next, read in the images and use your keyword file to map the column names.

```{r}
wc_keywords <- "index_exifattribute.csv"
image_folder <- "new_data"

test_raw <- gather_images(image_folder, wc_keywords, tag_sep = "\\)\\s")
```

Finally, prepare for analysis with **captrapr**:

```{r}
test_camtrapr  <- prep_camtrapr(test_raw, number_of_species = 3, wildcount = TRUE)
```
